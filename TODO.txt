TO DO

add lineoutline calculation and thus varying lineflow/volume option!
OR maybe just calculate left and right sides and draw line with path or symbol which allows curveto and outline.
SO eg, instead of drawing a polygon with full coordinates for round joins, 
just calculate linewidth sides and bezier points using curveto, which handles the outline for you. 
OR just do the line fill using the standard line drawing which should allow joins and caps in modified sourcecode,
then only for outline calculate the path and curveto, but maybe slower bc two operations, and wont allow varying thickness?

add basic image coloring/tinting ops

fix inverse transform pixel2coord

x/y data lengths by converting to pixels

make coordsys follow all image ops (rotate, flip, etc)

fix piechart label placement with some custom coordinate calculation...? or by returning bbox info for each drawn shape (see below)?

add all chart label functionality properly working





FUTURE

allow multiple text sizes incl percent (not just points)

allow draw svg, using svgfig module to load them




MAYBE

have each draw op return shape obj that have coords, bounding box, center, and compass directions for placement. 

support drawing lineoutline, by manual calculating line offsets and intersections based on left or right turn (see pydraw)

allow basic gradients

maybe draw circle and square should have fillsize as custom arg instead of part of **kwoptions, but maybe not
